# Interoperability architecture

An OP Stack node consists of two pieces of software: a consensus client (e.g. op-node) and an execution client, which is responsible for processing user transactions and constructing blocks. Interoperability among OP Stack chains is enabled via a new service called 
[*OP Supervisor*](/stack/interop/op-supervisor). Every node operator is expected to run this service in addition to the [rollup node](/builders/node-operators/architecture#rollup-node) and [execution client](/builders/node-operators/architecture#execution-client).

  end

  chain3-->|log events|super1
  l1node-->|block status|super1

  class chain1,chain2,chain3 chain
  class X transparent
```

OP-Supervisor holds a database of all the log events of all the chains in the interoperability cluster.
Every event can potentially initiate a cross domain message, and it is the job of OP-Supervisor to validate that the log event really happened on the source chain.
Additionally, OP-Supervisor reads information from L1's consensus layer to determine the transaction safety of L2 blocks.

## How messages get from one chain to the other

To understand *why* we need this additional service, it is useful to know how interop messages get from one blockchain to another.

```mermaid

sequenceDiagram
    participant app as Application
    participant src as Source Chain
    box rgba(0,0,0,0.1) Destination Chain
      participant dst-sup as OP-Supervisor
      participant dst-geth as Execution Engine
    end
    app->>src: Transaction
    src->>dst-sup: Log Event
    note over src,dst-sup: Log Event = Initializing Message
    app->>dst-geth: Transaction
    dst-geth->>dst-geth: Call to CrossL2Inbox to execute or verify a message.
    dst-geth->>dst-sup: Did you receive this initiating message?
    dst-sup->>dst-geth: Yes
    note left of dst-geth: Call is successful
    dst-geth->>dst-geth: CrossL2Inbox emits ExecutingMessage.
    note over dst-geth: Executing Message
```

Cross domain messages require two transactions.
The first transaction creates an *initiating message* on the source chain.
The second transaction creates an *executing message* on the destination chain.
This executing message could result in a contract function being executed on the destination chain.

The initiating message is simply a log event.
Any log event on any chain that inteoperates with the destination can initiate a cross domain message.

The transaction that receives the message on the destination chain calls a contract called [`CrossL2Inbox`](https://specs.optimism.io/interop/predeploys.html#crossl2inbox).
This call can be at the top level, directly from the externally owned account, or come through a smart contract.
The call to `CrossL2Inbox`, also known as the *executing message*, needs to [identify the initiating message uniquely](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/CrossL2Inbox.sol#L35-L42), using the chain ID of the source chain, the block number, and the index of the log event within that block, as well as a few other fields as a sanity check.

`CrossL2Inbox` can either [validate the message exists](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/CrossL2Inbox.sol#L171-L185), or [call a contract if the message exists](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/CrossL2Inbox.sol#L171-L185).

## Safety levels

```mermaid

    classDef finalized fill:#CCC
    classDef safe fill:#8F8
    classDef unsafe fill:#F89
    subgraph I[Blocks with Initiating Messages]
    style I fill:none
      subgraph A[Chain A]
        A0[Block n]
        A1[Block n+100]
        A2[Block n+105]
        class A0 finalized
        class A1 safe
        class A2 unsafe
      end
      subgraph B[Chain B]
        B0[Block m]
        B1[Block m+3]
        class B0,B1 safe
      end
    end
    subgraph C[Chain C]
      C0[Block with executing messages]
      class C0 unsafe
    end
    A0 --> C0
    A1 --> C0
    A2 --> C0
    B0 --> C0
    B1 --> C0 
```

Interop expands the scope of trust for unsafe blocks, blocks that are shared through [the gossip protocol](/builders/chain-operators/architecture#sequencer).
To trust that an unsafe block is valid and is going to become safe and then finalized, you need to trust not only the sequencer that produces it, but also all the other sequencers that produce other blocks that are still unsafe, but that include initiating messages that are executed in that block.

However, this is only for *unsafe* blocks, and only if the sequencer allows messages from unsafe blocks to be processed.
A block is only considered promotable to *safe*, and therefore ready to be written to L1, when all the blocks on which it depends are safe.

For example, in the image below, most blocks are safe.
Block `n` in chain `A` is even finalized, and immune from reorgs.
However, block `n+105` in chain `A` is unsafe, it (or a block on which it depends) is not written to L1.
Because the new block depends upon it, it is also unsafe.
