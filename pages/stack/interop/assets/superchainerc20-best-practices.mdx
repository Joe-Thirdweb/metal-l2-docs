# Best practices for managing SuperchainERC20 tokens

The following best practices are essential for deploying and managing `SuperchainERC20` assets across the Superchain. These guidelines help ensure optimal cross-chain functionality.

Note that the total supply of your tokens never fluctuates across the Superchain. Cross-chain burning and minting only affects the location of a token across the Superchain.

## Consistent addresses across chains

Use predefined addresses: Assign and verify the same address for each `SuperchainERC20` instance on every chain. Predefined addresses reduce deployment conflicts and ensure tokens are accurately recognized across chains. Otherwise, the SuperchainERC20Bridge would need a way to verify if the tokens they mint on destination correspond to the tokens that were burned on source.

Consider using `Create2Deployer` or one of our [predeploys](https://specs.optimism.io/interop/predeploys.html) to ensure this.

## Testing before mainnet deployment

Test with production-like conditions: Deploy to staging environments that simulate mainnet conditions, especially for functions like `crosschainBurn` and `crosschainMint`. Test under realistic transaction loads to validate performance.

We recommend using [Supersim](https://supersim.pages.dev/introduction) as an easy way to simulate the Superchain and test your SuperchainERC20 deployment.

Test edge cases such as maximum balance transfers and interchain latency to ensure asset reliability across different scenarios.
