# App Developer Overview

If you're a developer looking to build on Metal L2, you've come to the right place.
Here you'll find everything you need to know about building Metal L2 applications for deployment on the Superchain Banking Layer, Metal L2.

## Getting started

If you're brand new to Metal L2, try starting with the guide on [deploying a basic contract](/chain/getting-started).
It'll get you familiar with the basic steps required to get a contract deployed to the network.
Metal L2 is [EVM equivalent](https://web.archive.org/web/20231127160757/https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306) so you can feel confident that your existing Ethereum smart contract skills will carry over to Metal L2.
Just make sure to be aware of the few small [differences between Ethereum and Metal L2](/stack/differences).

You might also want to check out the [testing on Metal L2 guide](/chain/testing/testing-apps) and the tutorial on [running a local development environment](/chain/testing/dev-node) to help you feel totally confident in your Metal L2 deployment.

## Bridging and messaging

Looking to build an application that sends ETH, tokens, or data between Metal L2 and Ethereum?
You'll find some useful guides and tutorials in this area of the docs.
For instance, if you want to learn how to bridge a token from Ethereum to Metal L2 (or vice versa!), you should check out the [Standard Token Bridge](bridging/standard-bridge).

If you're looking for something more advanced, take a look at the guide on [sending data between L1 and L2](bridging/messaging).
Contracts on one chain can trigger contract functions on the other chain, it's pretty cool!
The Standard Token Bridge for Metal L2 even uses this same message-passing infrastructure under the hood.

## Tutorials

If you're a bit more familiar with Metal L2 and Ethereum, you can try walking through one of the tutorials put together by the Optimism community.
They'll help you get a head start when building your first Optimistic project.
