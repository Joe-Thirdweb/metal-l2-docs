# Superchain App quick start

This quick start walks you through an easy three-step process to deploy an app to any OP Chain â€“ in under 15 minutes.
This quick start uses [`Scaffold-OP`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/scaffold-op) to build the Superchain App, covers the setup process, and links to more detailed guides, so you can dive a bit deeper when needed.

## Step 1: Get Testnet ETH from Superchain Faucet

You'll need some testnet ETH on OP Sepolia to pay for the [gas fees](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/) associated with deploying your test application.
Use the [Optimism Superchain Faucet](https://console.optimism.io/faucet?utm_source=scaffoldop) to get some free ETH on OP Sepolia for multiple OP Chains with just one click.
You can request testnet ETH from the Superchain Faucet in one of two ways: **connect a wallet** or **login with Github**.

*   If you **connect a wallet with an Optimist NFT**, you can get up to 1 testnet ETH per network every 24 hours.
*   If you **login with Github**, you can get up to 0.05 testnet ETH per day.

  You can also try using [other available OP Sepolia faucets](/builders/tools/build/faucets).

## Step 2: Build a basic app with Scaffold-OP

Scaffold-OP is a fork of [`scaffold-ETH2`](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/) with minimal differences: additional app examples, native support for Superchain testnets, and more low-level instructions.
Scaffold-OP is an open-source toolkit for building decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain and is designed to make it easier for developers to create and deploy smart contracts and
build user interfaces that interact with those contracts.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

*   [node v18.17 or higher](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
*   yarn [v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
*   [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

<Steps>
  {<h3>Clone the Repo & Install Dependencies</h3>}

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/scaffold-op.git
  cd scaffold-op
  yarn install
  ```

  {<h3>Run a Local Network</h3>}

  Use the first terminal to run a local network:

  ```sh
  yarn chain
  ```

  This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development.
  You can customize the network configuration in `hardhat.config.ts`.

  {<h3>Deploy the Test Contract</h3>}

  Use the second terminal to deploy the contract:

  ```sh
  yarn deploy
  ```

  This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs.
  The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/hardhat/deploy` to deploy the contract to the network.

  <Callout>
    You can also customize the deploy script to **add a new contract** by following these instructions:

    *   Create a corresponding deployment file in `package/hardhat/deploy` to specify the deployment process.
    *   For simpler contract deployment: copy over an existing deployment script in the deploy folder and modify the file name and variables.
    *   For more advanced usage: refer to [Hardhat's deployment docs](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy?tab=readme-ov-file#deploymentsdeployname-options) to see what parameters you can specify.
  </Callout>

  {<h3>Start your NextJS App</h3>}

  Use the second terminal to start your NextJS app:

  ```sh
   yarn start
  ```

  *   Visit your app on `http://localhost:3000`.
  *   You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app configuration in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

  <Image src="/img/builders/app-developers/quick-start/scaffold-op2.png" alt="Scaffold-OP Debug Contracts page" width={600} height={500} />

  Run smart contract test with `yarn hardhat:test`

  *   Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`
  *   Edit your frontend in `packages/nextjs/pages`
  *   Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`
</Steps>

## Step 3: Deploy contracts to Superchain Testnets

You will follow the steps below to deploy contracts to a remote testnet (e.g., Optimism Sepolia).
Please ensure you have enough Sepolia ETH on all these Superchains before deploying (See [Step 1 above](#step-1-get-testnet-eth-from-superchain-faucet)).

<Steps>
  {<h3>Make the `.env` file</h3>}

  Inside the `packages/hardhat` directory, copy `.env.example` to `.env.`

  ```sh
  cd packages/hardhat && cp .env.example .env
  ```

  {<h3>Specify the Environment Variables</h3>}

  Edit your `.env` to specify the environment variables. At a minimum, you must specify the `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`.

  ```sh
  DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY = "your_private_key_with_sepolia_ETH";
  ```

  <Callout type="warning">
    The contract will be deployed from the address associated with this private key, so make sure it has enough Sepolia ETH (See [Step 1 above](#step-1-get-testnet-eth-from-superchain-faucet)).
  </Callout>

  {<h3>Deploy Smart Contracts to Selected Networks</h3>}

  This step deploys all smart contracts in `packages/hardhat/contracts` to the selected network(s). Network names are found in `hardhat.config.js`.

  *   Inside `scaffold-op`, run one of the following options:

  <Tabs items={['option A', 'option B']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
      ```sh
      yarn deploy --network-options
      ```
    </Tabs.Tab>

    <Tabs.Tab>
      ```sh
      yarn deploy --network networkName
      ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
  </Tabs>

  *   Use spacebar to make your selection(s).

  <Callout type="info">
    If the deployments are successful, you will see the deployment transaction hash on the terminal.
  </Callout>
</Steps>

Congratulations! You now have an OP Mainnet app ready for development, which can also be deployed to more OP Chains! ðŸŽ‰
