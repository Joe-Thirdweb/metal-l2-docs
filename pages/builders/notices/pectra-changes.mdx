## For node operators

Node operators will need to upgrade to the respective releases before the activation dates.

These following steps are necessary for every node operator:

<Steps>
  ### Update to the latest release

  <Callout type="info">
    The software is currently being tested and we expect the releases to be cut by the end of this week (Jan 27th to 31st). 
  </Callout>

  *   `op-node` at `vTBD`
  *   `op-geth` at `vTBD`

  ### Verify Your Configuration

  Make the following checks to verify that your node is properly configured.

  *   `op-node` and `op-geth` will log their configurations at startup
  *   Check that the Pectra time is set to `activation-timestamp` in the op-node startup logs
  *   Check that the Pectra time is set to `activation-timestamp` in the op-geth startup logs
</Steps>
