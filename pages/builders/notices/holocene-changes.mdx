<Callout type="info">
  The Holocene upgrade for Metal L2 is scheduled for **Thu 9 Jan 2025 18:00:01 UTC**, [governance approval](https://vote.optimism.io/proposals/20127877429053636874064552098716749508236019236440427814457915785398876262515).

## What's included in Holocene

Holocene contains three changes:

*   **Holocene block derivation**: a set of changes that render the derivation pipeline stricter and simpler, improving worst-case scenarios for the Fault Proof System and Interoperability.
*   **EIP-1559 configurability**: The elasticity and denominator EIP-1559 parameters become configurable via the `SystemConfig` L1 contract, allowing the gas target and gas limit to be configured independently.
*   **MIPS contract upgrade**: Updates to support additional calls made by the new `op-program` version.

For more information on the Holocene implementation details, please review [Holocene specification](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/holocene/overview.html).

## For node operators

Node operators will need to upgrade to the respective Holocene releases before the activation dates. Please reach out to your Metal L2 contact for assistance.
