## Inclusion criteria

Developer teams who want to feature products/tools on this page must meet the following criteria:

1.  **ongoing partnership** with Optimism whether formal agreement, RPGF, RFP, collaborated on specific initiatives, etc.;
2.  **established user base** and OP ecosystem engagement such as governance participation, homegrown TG or Discord participation, etc.; and
3.  **actively maintained developer tool** that aligns with OP's commitment to a magical developer experience (e.g., easy-to-use, easy-to-integrate, great DevX, highly-rated by community, etc.)

For teams that are supporting but still establishing a user base, we encourage you to share your tool on the [community node providers page](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/developers/blob/main/community/tools/node-providers.md).
You can also promote your tool in the [developer forum](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/developers/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) and signup to share your tool at the next [demo day](https://community.optimism.io/docs/contribute/demo-day/).
