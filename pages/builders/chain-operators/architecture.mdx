# Chain architecture

This page contains information about the components of the rollup protocol and
how they work together to build the layer 2 blockchain from the Chain Operator's
perspective. The OP Stack is built in such a way that it is as similar to
Ethereum as possible. Like Ethereum, the OP Stack has execution and consensus
clients. The OP Stack also has some privileged roles that produce L2 blocks.
If you want a more detailed view of the OP Stack protocol, check out the
[OP Stack section](/stack/getting-started) of our documentation.

## Permissioned components

These clients and services work together to enable the block production on the L2 network.
Sequencer nodes (`op-geth` + `op-node`) gather proposed transactions from users.
The batcher submits batch data to L1 which controls the safe blocks and ultimately
controls the canonical chain. The proposer submits output roots to L1 which control
L2 to L1 messaging.

### op-geth

`op-geth` implements the layer 2 execution layer, with [minimal changes](https://op-geth.optimism.io/)
for a secure Ethereum-equivalent application environment.

### op-node

`op-node` implements most rollup-specific functionality as the layer 2
consensus layer, similar to a layer 1 beacon-node. The `op-node` is stateless and gets
its view of the world from `op-geth`.

### op-batcher

`op-batcher` is the service that submits the L2 Sequencer data to L1, to make it available
for verifiers. To reduce the cost of writing to the L1, it only posts the minimal
amount of data required to reproduce L2 blocks.

### op-proposer

## Ingress traffic

It is important to setup a robust chain architecture to handle large volumes of RPC
requests from your users. The Sequencer node has the important job of working with
the batcher to handle block creation. To allow the Sequencer to focus on that job,
you can peer replica nodes to handle the rest of the work.

An example of this would be to configure [proxyd](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/chain-operators/tools/proxyd)
to route RPC methods, retry failed requests, load balance, etc. Users sending
`eth_sendRawTransaction` requests can have their requests forwarded directly to the
Sequencer. All other RPC requests can be forwarded to replica nodes.

### proxyd

This tool is an RPC request router and proxy. It does the following things:

1.  Whitelists RPC methods.
2.  Routes RPC methods to groups of backend services.
3.  Automatically retries failed backend requests.
4.  Track backend consensus (latest, safe, finalized blocks), peer count and sync state.
5.  Re-write requests and responses to enforce consensus.
6.  Load balance requests across backend services.
7.  Cache immutable responses from backends.
8.  Provides metrics to measure request latency, error rates, and the like.

### Sequencer

The Sequencer node works with the batcher and proposer to create new blocks. So it should
handle the state changing RPC request `eth_sendRawTransaction`. It can be peered with
replica nodes to gossip new `unsafe` blocks to the rest of the network.

<Callout type="info">
To run a rollup, you need a minimum of one archive node. This is required by the proposer as the data that it needs can be older than the data available to a full node.  Note that since the proposer doesn't care what archive node it points to, you can technically point it towards an archive node that isn't the sequencer. 
</Callout>

### Replica node

The replica nodes are additional nodes on the network. They can be peered to the Sequencer,
which might not be connected to the rest of the internet, and other replicas. Additional
replicas can help horizontally scale RPC requests.
