{/* # Metal L2 Security Model

Metal L2 is a work in progress.
Constant, iterative improvement of the security mechanisms that safeguard Metal L2 users is a top priority for the entire [Optimism Collective](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/).
The Optimism Collective strives to be clear and transparent about the security of Metal L2 and the OP Stack as a whole.

## Bottom line

The security model of any blockchain system is only as strong as its lowest common denominator.
At the moment, **it's important to understand that the security of Metal L2 is dependent on a [multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5a0Aae59D09fccBdDb6C6CcEB07B7279367C3d2A)** managed jointly by the [Optimism Security Council](https://gov.optimism.io/t/intro-to-optimisms-security-council/6885) and the Optimism Foundation.
Metal L2 and the OP Stack in general **may also contain unknown bugs that could lead to the loss of some or all of the ETH or tokens held within the system**.

## Metal L2 multisig

The security of Metal L2 is currently dependent on a multisig managed jointly by the [Optimism Security Council](https://gov.optimism.io/t/intro-to-optimisms-security-council/6885) and the Optimism Foundation.
This multisig is a [2-of-2 nested multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5a0Aae59D09fccBdDb6C6CcEB07B7279367C3d2A) which is in turn governed by a [10-of-13 multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc2819DC788505Aac350142A7A707BF9D03E3Bd03) managed by the Optimism Security Council and a [5-of-7 multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x847B5c174615B1B7fDF770882256e2D3E95b9D92) managed by the Optimism Foundation.

This multisig can be used to upgrade core Metal L2 smart contracts **without upgrade delays** to allow for quick responses to potential security concerns.
All upgrades to the Metal L2 system must be approved by both component multisigs and either can veto an upgrade.

## Fault proofs

<Callout>
  It is important to understand that **fault proofs are not a silver bullet** and that **fault proofs provide limited improvements to the security of a system if the system still has a multisig or security council that can instantly upgrade the system**.
  Metal L2 is following a multi-client and multi-proof approach designed to eventually remove the need for instant upgrades entirely.
</Callout>

Users can withdraw ETH and tokens from Metal L2 to Ethereum by submitting a withdrawal proof that shows the withdrawal was actually included inside of Metal L2.
Withdrawals are proven against proposals about the state of Metal L2 that are published through the [`DisputeGameFactory`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/363c5d7f4fb14180a0e2a28cc948fe2146f03dce/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/DisputeGameFactory.sol) contract.

Proposals can be submitted to the `DisputeGameFactory` contract by any user and submissions do not require any special permissions.
Each submitted proposal creates a [`FaultDisputeGame`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/dispute/FaultDisputeGame.sol) contract that allows any other user to challenge the validity of a proposal by participating in a "fault proof" process.
A more detailed explanation of the fault proof game can be found in the [Fault Proofs Explainer](/stack/fault-proofs/explainer).

Although the fault proof game is permissionless, the Optimism Security Council acting as the [Guardian](/chain/security/privileged-roles#guardian) role provides a backstop in case of a failure in the fault proof game.
Each proposal must wait for a delay period during which the Guardian can prevent invalid proposals from being used to withdraw ETH or tokens through a number of safety hatches.
The Guardian can also choose to shift the system to use a `PermissionedDisputeGame` in which only specific `PROPOSER` and `CHALLENGER` roles can submit and challenge proposals.

## Bugs and unknowns

Please also keep in mind that just like any other system, **the Optimism codebase may contain unknown bugs** that could lead to the loss of some or all of the ETH or tokens held within the system.
The OP Stack has been audited [on many occasions](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/v1.1.4/technical-documents/security-reviews), but **audits are not a stamp of approval** and **a completed audit does not mean that the audited codebase is free of bugs.**

It's important to understand that using Metal L2 inherently exposes you to the risk of bugs within the Optimism codebase, and that you use Metal L2 at your own risk.

## Work in progress

### Sequencer decentralization

The Optimism Foundation currently operates the sole sequencer on Metal L2.
Although users can always bypass the Sequencer by sending transactions directly to the [`OptimismPortal`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/5877ee24cc9aaef5848c1372e0e196707fb336a0/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L1/OptimismPortal.sol) contract, sequencer decentralization can still help mitigate the effect of short-term outages for users.

## Security model FAQ

### Does Metal L2 have fault proofs?

**Yes**, Metal L2 has fault proofs.
It is important to note that **fault proofs are not a silver bullet** and that **fault proofs provide limited improvements to the security of a system if the system still has a multisig or security council that can instantly upgrade the system**.
A system with fast upgrade keys, such as Metal L2, is fully dependent on the upgrade keys for security.
Metal L2's goal is to be the first system that deploys fault proofs that can secure the system by themselves, without fast upgrade keys.

### How is Optimism planning to remove the multisig?

Check out Optimism's detailed [Pragmatic Path to Decentralization](https://web.archive.org/web/20230331065342/https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/our-pragmatic-path-to-decentralization-cb5805ca43c1) post for a detailed view into how the multisig may be removed in a way that makes Metal L2 the first chain with true fault proof security.

### How can I help make Metal L2 more secure?

[Metal L2 has one of the biggest bug bounties (ever)](/chain/security/security-policy).
You can earn up to $2,000,042 by finding critical bugs in the Optimism codebase.
You can also run your own verifier node to detect network faults.

### Where do I report bugs?

For details about reporting vulnerabilities and available bug bounty programs, see the [Security Policy](/chain/security/security-policy). */}
